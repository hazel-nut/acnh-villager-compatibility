## Description

Based on compatibility as outlined in [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Compatibility), which is based on guides published for earlier games by Nintendo.

Mostly created as the [Japamori](https://d.japamori.com/en/) site I previously used wasn't updated for 2.0. I believe that the ratings are equivalent, but my understanding of their detailed explanation (which was in Japanese) may be suspect. However it appears to be the same as what is described in [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Compatibility), though with slightly more importance placed on species compatibility. 

The villager data used here is static data pulled from [Nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Compatibility) on 2/20/22.
